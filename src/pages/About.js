              My name is Charles Zoeller. I was born in Denver, Colorado, where
              I have lived for most of my life. I love to ski with friends and
              family whenever I can. My parents first started teaching me how to
              ski when I was 5 years old. I really enjoy reading science fiction
              and fantasy novels. My favorite authors are Erin Morgenstern,
              Maddeline Miller, and Brandon Sanderson. I recently became pretty
              enterested in cooking and baking. I've made Beef Wellington,
              Cheesecake, and Soft Pretzels.
